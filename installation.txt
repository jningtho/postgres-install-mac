#Guide: Postgresql Installation on Mac.

#I was in the process of installing Postgresql on my mac but couldn't find any step-by step process without having to set a variable path. 
#After looking around, came across few docs and compiled them to make it as easy as possible.
#Brew is the easiest and simplest process and got this working in no time.

Environment:
- MacOS Sierra 10.12.6
- Postgresql  9.6.4
- Homebrew    1.3.1
- Shell    ~/.zshrc

# ** Current status: Assuming you already have the current Brew installed, here are the steps.

#1. Let's get postgres via brew.

 ~/ [master*] brew install postgresql

==> Caveats
If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/2510

To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.0) of PostgreSQL, see:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/upgrading.html

To migrate existing data from a previous minor version (9.0-9.5) of PostgreSQL, see:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/pgupgrade.html

  You will need your previous PostgreSQL installation from brew to perform `pg_upgrade`.
  Do not run `brew cleanup postgresql` until you have performed the migration.

To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
